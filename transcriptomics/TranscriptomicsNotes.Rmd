Oct 15th
- today we looked at differential expression between developmental temperatures
- we used an MA plot and heatmap to look at relative expression (down regulation and upregulation)
- we looked at how to extract one comparison from the DEseq analysis, and how to interpret expression (importance of knowing which treatment is treated as the "control")
